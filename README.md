# Cap-Stone-Project--2-Personal-Website
Created using HTML and CSS, for layout I used flexbox, and I could not make it responsive to mobile especially the skills section I don't know why and how to make the image and text to take 100% width , I Hope Future Sandeep Will come and correct the bugs of this website one day ;)
